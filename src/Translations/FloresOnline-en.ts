const DESC_PROJETO = `Flores Online is an application for buying flowers and gifts via partners. It also has a page where partners offer their own products. It was developed in React Native and Typescript and will be available soon for Android and iOS.
I'm currently working on this project and we're finalizing details to launch the app in stores.
I worked only on the frontent, developing screens and their features.`

const DESAFIO = `This project did not have any specific challenge as we used the Isabela Flores app project as a basis. But I had several learnings researching and implementing new technologies.`

const APRENDIZADO = `With this project I learned how to implement react-forms to facilitate the application and maintenance of multiple inputs on the same screen.
    It replaces the use of AsyncStorage as cache by MMKV which has a much higher read speed and is synchronous, unlike AsyncStorage.
    I optimized the use of redux with the new Redux Toolkit framework, making implementation and maintenance easier.
    I improved my skills in using typescript using it 100% from the frontend.`
