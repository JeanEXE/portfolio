    'prj2.description': `Gingo Business is a store/order management and real-time chat application, where establishments can control orders, edit or include products in the catalog and contact users at any time.
    The app was developed in React Native, the backend of the marketplace in Magento(PHP) and the chat in Node.js. I worked on this project from its beginning until its publication in stores (Android/iOS).
    I worked on the development of frontend marketplace screens and functionalities, such as registration/login, screen to include products in the establishment's catalog, distance shipping functionality, definition of store opening/closing times, etc...
