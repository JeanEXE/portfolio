const PROJECT_DESC = `Isabela Flores is a marketplace app for purchasing flowers and gifts through partners. Users can make purchases via the app, select a specific date and time for delivery, and review their orders directly in the app. The app also provides a page where partners can showcase and sell their own products. It was developed in React Native and TypeScript and is available for both Android and iOS.
    I was responsible for technical decisions, working on the frontend from the beginning of the project through to its release in the app stores, and maintaining the CI/CD pipeline using AppCenter (CodePush).`

const CHALLENGE = `My biggest challenge was developing the product filtering screen and the cart, as both have many business rules.`

const LEARNING = `With this project, I learned to develop using TypeScript, applying it to 100% of the frontend.
I also learned to write End-to-End automated tests using Detox.
Additionally, I learned how to use redux-persist.`
