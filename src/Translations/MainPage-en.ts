    about: `Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Jean, I've been working as a mobile developer since 2019. I worked as a Fullstack developer for a while using Node.JS on the backend, but my biggest stack is on the frontend with React-Native. I really enjoy dealing with performance and optimizations, and I always try to apply concepts of clean code and abstraction. I'm curious, responsible, and consider myself to be quite proactive.

    Feedback is always welcome. I value teamwork and I'm concerned about helping beginners because I've been there and I understand how difficult it is to start. I like to contribute ideas and my opinion on something that I see as a possible improvement, that way I can share my knowledge and also learn new things with the team.
