    about: `Hello ðŸ‘‹, I'm Jean and I've been working as a developer since 2019. I worked as a Fullstack developer for some time, using Node.js on the backend, but my greatest experience is in frontend with React Native.
    
    Besides developing new features, I actively contribute to defining the architecture of applications, performance, code optimization, documentation, test coverage, and releasing updates to production. All while applying clean code concepts, design patterns, SOLID principles, responsive layouts, and agile development. I'm passionate about building successful products, teamwork, improving user experience, and efficiently solving problems.`,
