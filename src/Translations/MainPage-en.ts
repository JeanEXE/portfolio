    about: `Hi üëã I'm Jean. I've been working since 2018 as a fullstack developer using Node.JS as the main language on the backend, but my biggest stack is on the frontend (Mobile) with React-Native. I really like working with performance and optimizations, I always try to apply clean code and abstraction concepts. I am curious, responsible and consider myself quite proactive.

    Receiving feedback is always welcome. I value teamwork, I care about helping beginners because I've been through it and I understand how difficult the beginning is. I like to contribute with ideas and my opinion on something that I see as a possible improvement, this way I can share my knowledge and also learn new things with the team.

üå± I'm currently learning: TypeScript / E2E Testing / React.js / Styled Components

üèπ I Want to learn: GraphQL / Flutter
